voxycodone: an engine designed for raytracing voxels and putting them in a multiplayer game

----

dependencies: SDL2, SDL2\_mixer, libepoxy, Lua 5.3, zlib

(SDL2\_mixer isn't used right now but will be when I get my head around it -
 also, ENet will probably be used too)

uses datenwolf's linmath.h "licensed" under WTFPLv2 (Public Domain)

my compile + run flags:

    make && ./voxycodone

APPLIES TO NON-WIN32 BUILDS: run from this directory or else it will choke

licence MIT, see LICENCE file

if you wish to use this engine in your commercial projects and you cannot make
head or tail of it, don't be a cheapskate, hire me
