IMPORTANT: Functions marked with "@@@" can have their state mutilated between contexts.
Do NOT rely on any "defaults" for these after a context switch!

Context switches can happen due to these:

* sandbox.poll() was called.
* New sandbox was created.
* Hook finished executing.
* Metamethod called on target sandbox.send function.
  * This behaviour may be deprecated if it's found to be too difficult to secure.
    Having said that, it's not a recommended practice.

Quick notes on types.

* b = boolean
* f = float
* i = integer
  * 0i = 0-based index
  * 1i = 1-based index
* str = string
* SomethingRef = an opaque reference. Even if it's an integer, do not modify it.
* SomethingTable = a Lua table that's probably not an array.
* something[] = a 1D array

Special types:

* VMTypeStr: A sandbox/VM type to make:
  * "blind"
  * "client"
  * "server"
  * "plugin"
* TexTypeStr: A texture type which maps accordingly:
  * "1": GL_TEXTURE_1D
  * "2": GL_TEXTURE_2D
  * "3": GL_TEXTURE_3D
  * "1a": GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY
  * "2a": GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY
* TexFiltStr: Magnification and minification filters.
  * First char: Magnification
    * 'n': GL_NEAREST
    * 'l': GL_LINEAR
  * Second char: Minification. Same as above, or...
  * Third char: Optional, sets the minification mipmap mode.
    * If this exists, then mag filter is GL_second_MIPMAP_third
    * Otherwise, mag filter is
  * So basically, "nll" is GL_NEAREST min, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR mag.
* TexFmtStr: Texture format string.
  * First char is a number denoting the number of components, from 1 to 4.
  * Second char:
    * "b": GL_BYTE (signed)
    * "s": GL_SHORT (signed)
    * "i": GL_INT (signed)
    * "f": GL_FLOAT (signed)
    * "ub": GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
    * "us": GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT
    * "ui": GL_UNSIGNED_INT
    * "Nb": GL_BYTE, normalised internally (signed)
    * "Ns": GL_SHORT, normalised internally (signed)
    * "nb": GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, normalised internally
    * "ns": GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, normalised internally
  * If it doesn't exist, don't use it.

(global namespace)
------------------

data:str = bin_load(fname:str):
	Loads the binary file "fname" and returns the data as a string.

	Returns nil on error.

	Errors include:
	- root directory + filename exceeding 255 chars in length
	  - This limit would be higher if it weren't for Windows. Fuck Windows.
	  - As a sidenote, limit is currently checked relative to the current directory.
	    So on Windows it can blow over the limit anyway.
	    Solution: Use a real OS.

draw
----

width:i, height:i = draw.screen_size_get():
	Obtain the virtual screen resolution.

	Two things to factor in:
	* This could technically be an FBO.
	* The size can change, but has to be explicitly changed from within the same VM (TODO)

draw.blit():
	DEPRECATED API, WILL BE REMOVED SOON

	Draw a fullscreen rectangle.

	Really only useful for raytracing.

draw.buffers_set(buf_list:0i[]): @@@
	glDrawBuffers(#buf_list, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 + buf_list);

	Useful for setting up FBOs with multiple outputs.
	
	A good list to pass when you're done is {0}.

draw.viewport_set(x:i, y:i, xlen:i, ylen:i): @@@
	glViewport(x, y, xlen, ylen);

	Bottom-left origin. Measured in pixels.

	You'll want to set this after switching to a different-sized render target.

fbo
---

fb:FBORef = fbo.new():
	Create an FBO handle.

fbo.bind_tex(fb:FBORef, attachment_idx:0i, texture_type:TexTypeStr, tex:TexRef, level:0i):
	Binds a texture to an FBO.

fbo.target_set(fb:FBORef/nil): @@@
	Sets the current FBO.
	nil denotes default target.

	WARNING: This tends to get overwritten by these calls:
	* sandbox.new

	It also gets explicitly set to nil on context switch.

isvalid:b = fbo.validate(fb:FBORef):
	Checks if an FBO is valid.

matrix
------

mat:Mat4 = matrix.new():
	Create a new 4x4 matrix.

matrix.identity(mA:Mat4):
	Resets a matrix to the identity matrix.

matrix.rotate_X(mA:Mat4, mB:Mat4, radians:f):
matrix.rotate_Y(mA:Mat4, mB:Mat4, radians:f):
matrix.rotate_Z(mA:Mat4, mB:Mat4, radians:f):
	Rotates mB around the given axis and stores the result in mA.

matrix.translate_in_place(mA:Mat4, dx:f, dy:f, dz:f):
	Translates mA in-place by <dx,dy,dz>.

matrix.invert(mA:Mat4, mB:Mat4):
	Calculates the inverse of mB and stores the result in mA.

misc
----

misc.exit():
	Sets the quit flag, allowing the program or sandbox to quit.

	This does not immediately quit, however, so you should return ASAP.

	PLEASE DO NOT RELY ON THAT BEHAVIOUR, IT MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE.

err:i = misc.gl_error():
	glGetError();

	Returns the GL error state, and then resets the error code.

misc.mouse_grab_set(arg:b):
	Sets/clears mouse grab.

	Also affects visibility.

misc.mouse_visible_set(arg:b):
	Sets/clears mouse visibility.

sandbox
-------

vm:VMRef/nil = sandbox.new(typ:VMTypeStr, ...):
_G:Table/nil = sandbox.new("blind", code:str):
	Create a sandbox with the given type.
	Returns nil on failure.
	Returns the global table if you used a blind VM.
	Returns a VMRef if you used a normal VM.

	Arguments to be provided for each type:

	* blind: A string containing Lua code to be parsed and executed.
	* client: A string containing a hostname and an int containing a UDP port to connect to.
	* server, plugin: A string containing a root directory relative to the current VM's path.

	VMs that can be created by each type:

	* blind: NONE
	* client: blind (cannot create anything that can access anything! possible security issue)
	* server: plugin, blind
	* plugin: blind
	* system: server, client, plugin, blind

	Code will be run before execution.
	For non-blind contexts, the code will be fetched from "main.lua" in the context root.

tex:TexRef/nil = sandbox.fbo_get_tex(vm:VMRef):
	Get the colour texture for the FBO used by this sandbox.

	You cannot get your parent's FBO textures.

	Returns nil if the sandbox doesn't have an FBO.

sandbox.poll(vm:VMRef):
	Call hook_poll on this sandbox.

	No, you cannot poll your parent.

sandbox.send(vm:VMRef/true, ...):
	Sends a message to the given VM's mailbox.
	If vm is true, send to the current VM's parent.

	Arguments can be any of the following types:
	* nil
	* boolean
	* string
	* number
	* integer

	Any other types will be rejected.

sandbox.mbox:
	A table containing this VM's mailbox.
	The mailbox directly references this.

	Entries begin with the source VM
	(or true if it comes from the parent),
	then the arguments follow afterwards.

	You can set this to pretty much anything,
	but if it's not a table, expect it to crash.
	(Best to just set it to an empty table after checking its contents.)

shader
------

sh:ShaderRef = shader.new(srclist:ShaderTable, in_attrs:str[], out_binds:str[]):
	ShaderTable is a table with these args:
		vert = :str, -- Vertex shader source
		frag = :str, -- Fragment shader source
		geom = :str, -- Geometry shader source (optional)

	Creates a new shader with the inputs and outputs bound appropriately.

	Returns nil on failure.

	This will be fixed before the API reaches a point
	where I would actually care about backwards compatibility.

shader.use(sh:ShaderRef/nil): @@@
	glUseProgram(sh);

	Sets the shader to be used for rendering.

loc:0i = shader.uniform_location_get(sh:ShaderRef, name:str):
	Gets the location of a uniform in a shader.
	
	This location can be passed to the appropriate `shader.uniform_*` function.

shader.uniform_matrix_4f(loc:0i, val:Mat4):
	Sets a matrix uniform in the current shader.

shader.uniform_f(loc:0i, x:f [, y:f [, z:f [, w:f]]]): @@@
	Sets a float|vec[234] uniform in the current shader.

shader.uniform_i(loc:0i, x:f [, y:f [, z:f [, w:f]]]): @@@
	Sets an int|ivec[234] uniform in the current shader.

shader.uniform_ui(loc:0i, x:f [, y:f [, z:f [, w:f]]]): @@@
	Sets a uint|uvec[234] uniform in the current shader.

shader.uniform_fv(loc:0i, elements:i, dims:i in [1,4], data:f[]): @@@
	Sets a float|vec[234] uniform array in the current shader.

shader.uniform_iv(loc:0i, elements:i, dims:i in [1,4], data:f[]): @@@
	Sets an int|ivec[234] uniform array in the current shader.

shader.uniform_uiv(loc:0i, elements:i, dims:i in [1,4], data:f[]): @@@
	Sets a uint|uvec[234] uniform array in the current shader.

texture
-------

tex:TexRef = texture.new(target:TexTypeStr, levels:i, int_fmt:TexFmtStr,
		xsize:i [, ysize:i [, zsize:i]],
		filt:TexFiltStr,
		fmt:TexFmtStr
		):

	Creates a new texture.

	"fmt" is there to make this behave with glTexImage*D without throwing an error.
	The issue doesn't occur when we use glTexStorage*D, but that's core in 4.2.
	It may be available in an extension, but DO NOT ASSUME THAT EVERYONE HAS IT!

	(If in doubt, set fmt to the same thing as int_fmt.)

texture.unit_set(unit:0i, target:TexTypeStr, tex:TexRef): @@@
	Sets a texture unit to a given texture.

	WARNING: This tends to get overwritten by these calls:
	* sandbox.new
	* texture.new
	* texture.load_sub
	* texture.gen_mipmaps

	GL_ARB_direct_state_access is only core since GL 4.5,
	so we cannot assume everyone has it.

texture.load_sub(tex:TexRef, target:TexTypeStr, level:i,
		xoffs:i [, yoffs:i [, zoffs: i]],
		xsize:i [, ysize:i [, zsize: i]],
		fmt:TexFmtStr, data:*[]
		):

	Loads data into a texture.

	"data" is a 1D array which matches the texture format and size.
	It should have elems*xsize*ysize*zsize elements.

	Elements should be Lua floats for floating-point data,
	and Lua ints for integer data (regardless of sign).

texture.gen_mipmaps(tex:TexRef, target:TexTypeStr):
	Generates mipmaps for a texture using glGenerateMipmap.

voxel
-----

voxels:i[levels][] = voxel.decode_chunk(data:str, levels:i, chunkshift:i):
	ACCEL FUNCTION

	Decodes an SVO chunk into arrays.

	FIXME: Some arguments are unused and assume defaults (data, 5, 7).

voxel.upload_chunk_repeated(voxels:i[levels][], levels:i, chunkshift:i, xztexshift:i):
	ACCEL FUNCTION

	DEPRECATED API.

	Loads a chunk and repeats it over a 3D texture.

	FIXME: Some arguments are unused and assume defaults (voxels, 5, 7, 9).
